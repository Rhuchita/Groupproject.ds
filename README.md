# Caesar Cipher

The aim of the project is to encrypt/decrypt the message with a particular key. The message is converted into an unrecognizable text using the particular key and vice-versa.

Caesar ciphers can be found today in children's toys such as secret decoder rings. A Caesar shift of thirteen is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of obfuscating text widely found on Usenet and used to obscure text, but not seriously used as a method of encryption.
